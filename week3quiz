# Q1 - There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. 
# In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? 
# Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.

head(iris)

#apply(iris,2,mean)

#colMeans(iris$Sepal.Length,na.rm = TRUE)

mean(iris$Sepal.Length,na.rm = TRUE)
apply(iris[,1:4],2,mean)
# Q2- Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, 
# what R code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 
# 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?

apply(iris[,1:4],2,mean)

# Q3 - How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number of cylinders 
# in the car (cyl)?


tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
# or
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))
# or
sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)

# Q4- Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, 
# what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars
# and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?

mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == "8",]$hp) - mean(mtcars[mtcars$cyl == "4",]$hp)
